# Firebase Cloud Function for OpenAI Requests

This repository contains a Firebase Cloud Function that interacts with the OpenAI API to generate responses based on conversation input.

## Prerequisites

Before using this Cloud Function, make sure to complete the following steps:

1. **Set Your OpenAI API Key:**

   Obtain an API key from OpenAI and configure it in your Firebase project. You can set the API key using the Firebase CLI by running:

   
   firebase functions:config:set openai.apikey="YOUR_API_KEY" 

Add Axios Dependency:

Ensure that you have the Axios library installed in your Firebase project. If you haven't already installed it, you can add it using npm:

npm install axios
Installation

To deploy this Cloud Function, follow these steps:

    Navigate to the Functions Folder:

    Change your current directory to the "functions" folder of your Firebase project.

    bash

cd functions

Install Dependencies:

Install the necessary dependencies, including Axios, by running:



npm install

Deploy the Firebase Functions:

Deploy only the functions to Firebase using the Firebase CLI:

bash

    firebase deploy --only functions

Usage

You can now use the getOpenAIResponse function by making HTTP requests to the provided endpoint. The function takes a conversation parameter in the request body and returns the OpenAI response.

Example usage in JavaScript:

javascript

const functions = require("firebase-functions");
const axios = require("axios");

// Replace with your Firebase Cloud Function URL
const cloudFunctionURL = "YOUR_CLOUD_FUNCTION_URL";

const conversation = [
  { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." },
  { role: "user", content: "What's the weather like today?" },
];

axios
  .post(cloudFunctionURL, { conversation })
  .then((response) => {
    const openAIResponse = response.data.response;
    console.log("OpenAI Response:", openAIResponse);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  });

Make sure to replace YOUR_CLOUD_FUNCTION_URL with the actual URL of your deployed Cloud Function.
